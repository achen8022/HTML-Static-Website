    <h2> I am not really good at anything so I am not sure what I could
        teach you. I guess I could teach you how to ride a scooter if you
        guys did not already learn it. I also can teach you the basics of 
        the games I like to play in my free time. I am okay at other subjects
        in school other than history so I guess I can also help with that if you
        need help.
