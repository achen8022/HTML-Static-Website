    <h1>NYC,</h1>

    <h2>Some good places to visit in NYC would be the many parks around the areas. There are many parks
        around NYC, which are just a nice place to chill. I usually like to go Sunset Park in my free time.
        Another place you could visit is the Statue of Liberty or the Brooklyn Bridge. The view on Brooklyn
        Bridge is really beautiful. Another place you could visit would be Time Squares where there are a 
        lot of different shops and restaurants opened there. Here is a list of the bad things about NYC:
        <ol>
            <li>Too much traffic</li>
            <li>Way too overcrowded</li>
            <li>Rent is way too expensive</li>
            <li>You have to learn english to be able to get a job here</li>
            <li>The subway station is very unclean</li>
            <li>Most places are very disgusting</li>
        </ol>
